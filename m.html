            <p><span id="firstp">Horses are hoofed mammals that have lived with humans for thousands of  years.  </span>
			Almost all of the horses alive today are
			domesticated and descend from extinct wild horses. Horses have roamed the planet for about 50 million years

				Horses are adapted to run,  allowing  them to quickly escape predators, possessing  an excellent sense of balance and a strong fight Â¬or-flight response. </span> 
                Related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait: horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down, with younger horses tending to sleep significantly more than
				adults.[Female horses, called mares, carry their young for approximately 11 months, and a young horse, called a foal, can stand and run shortly following birth. Most domesticated horses begin training under a saddle or in a harness between the ages of two and four.</p>
