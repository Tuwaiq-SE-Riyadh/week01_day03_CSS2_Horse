            <b> <u> Horses are hoofed mammals that have lived with humans for thousands of years.</u></b>
             Almost all of the horses alive today are domesticated and descend from extinct wild horses.
              Horses have roamed the planet for about 50 million years.
              <br><b><u> Horses are adapted to run, allowing them to quickly escape predators, possessing an excellent sense of balance and a strong fight-or-flight response.</u></b>
              Related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait: horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down, with younger horses tending to sleep significantly more than adults.Female horses,
               called mares, carry their young for approximately 11 months,
               and a young horse, called a foal, can stand and run shortly
              following birth. Most domesticated horses begin training under a saddle or in a harness between the ages of two and four. They reach full adult development by age five, and have an average lifespan of between 25 and 30 years.
