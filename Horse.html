        <p><u>Horses are hoofed mammals that have lived with humans for thousands of years.</u>
            Almost all of the horses alive today are domesticated and descend from extinct wild horses. 
            Horses have roamed the planet for about 50 million years. 
            <br><br>
            <u>The earliest horses evolved in North America before spreading out to the rest of the world</u>
            , although they later became extinct in North America about 10,000 years ago.
            Horses are muscular animals with a long tail made up of coarse hair, 
            a long, thick neck draped with a mane down the midline, and an elongated head and skull. 
            Humans have created hundreds of different horse breeds through selective breeding, 
            which has resulted in many different horse coat colors, including chestnut, 
            gold with a white mane and tail (palomino), spotted, completely black and more, according to Oklahoma State University.
