            <p><b><u>Horses are hoofed mammals that have lived with humans for thousands of years.</b></u> Almost all of the horses alive today are domesticated and descend from extinct wild horses. Horses have roamed the planet for about 50 million years. <br><b><u>Horses are muscular animals with a long tail made up of coarse hair, a long, thick neck draped with a mane down the midline, and an elongated head and skull.</u></b> Humans have created hundreds of different horse breeds through selective breeding, which has resulted in many different horse coat colors, including chestnut, gold with a white mane and tail (palomino), spotted, completely black and more, according to Oklahoma State University.</p>
